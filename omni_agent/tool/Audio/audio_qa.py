    """
    Generate a global, high-level caption/description for the audio track of a video.

    This tool:
    1) Extracts the audio track from the given video file.
    2) Uses AudioLLM to listen to the entire audio and produce
       a single global description summarizing the main topics,
       structure, key events, speakers (if distinguishable), and overall tone.

    It is typically called once per video to obtain an overall understanding
    of the audio content, but the agent may call it again if needed.

    Args:
        video_path: Path or identifier of the video file from which
            the audio track will be extracted.

    Returns:
        A dictionary with:
            - "caption": a global, high-level description of the audio track.
