    Answer a free-form question about the overall visual content of a video.

    The agent can call this tool multiple times with different questions.
    This tool:
    1) Uniformly samples a set of frames from the entire duration of the video.
    2) Uses VideoLLM to inspect those frames and
       answer the question about what happens in the video as a whole.

    Args:
        video_path: Path or identifier of the video file.
        question: Any natural-language question about the global visual content.

    Returns:
        A dictionary with:

    Answer a free-form question about the visual content of a specific time range

    1) Densely samples a set of frames from the specified time range of the video.

       answer the question about what happens in that clip.

        video_path: Path or identifier of the video file.
        question: Any natural-language question about the visual content of the clip.
        time_range: A tuple (start_time, end_time) of POSITIVE INTEGERS in seconds.
            - Both start_time and end_time MUST be integers >= 0.
            - They must satisfy 0 <= start_time < end_time <= video_duration_in_seconds.
